"""
This is an example code for TU Dortmund summer-school-2020 Hackathon.

The example shows how the robot can be controlled using the APIs to complete
the whole task.

The competitiors needs only to write the make_prediction function to call their
machine learning trained model. The function should return the position of
the robot as (x,y) cooridnates. The example has a simple path planning
algortihm that can drive the robot around the arena to reach all the waypoints
specified for each team.

All robot frames specified in this code and the whole competition are according
to ROS (robot operating system) standards [for more info check ROS REP 105]
